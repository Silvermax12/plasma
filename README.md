> **"Code is not carved in stone; it is cultivated in the fertile soil of emergence."**

## 🧬 Experience Computational Evolution

**Plasma** transforms your browser into a digital Petri dish where computational cells are born, mutate, reproduce, and die—creating emergent ecosystems that no one programmed.

### 👉 [EXPERIENCE THE INTERACTIVE DEMO HERE](https://nabolitains.github.io/plasma) 👈

*Watch colonies form. Feed them. Disturb them. Be amazed.*

## 🤯 The Problem: The Illusion of Solidity

We still program like cathedral builders—carving monumental architectures from stone, destined for obsolescence. Every framework is a sarcophagus. Every design pattern, a prison.

**What if code could live, breathe, and evolve?**

## 🌊 The Solution: Morphogenetic Computing

Inspired by the slime mold (*Physarum polycephalum*)—the brainless organism that solves mazes—we propose a new paradigm where:

- **Code has a lifespan** (and that's healthy)
- **Bugs are mutations** (some are evolutionary)
- **Architecture emerges** (instead of being imposed)
- **Functions breathe** (absorbing neighboring capabilities)
- **Intention precedes instruction** (describe the 'what', not the 'how')

## 🔬 What You'll Find Here

- **`plasma.html`** - The first living cell: a complete simulation in a single file
- **`MANIFESTO.md`** - The 5 founding principles of morphogenetic programming
- **`/experiments`** - Your own mutations and evolutions of the code

## 🌿 How to Cultivate with Us

### To Observe and Learn
1.  **Clone** this garden: `git clone https://nabolitains.github.io/plasma`
2.  **Open** `plasma.html` in your browser
3.  **Observe** for 1000 cycles without intervening
4.  **Experiment**: click to feed, disturb the ecosystem

### To Contribute to the Evolution
- **🐛 Issues**: Share your strange observations, interesting mutations, philosophical questions
- **🧪 Pull Requests**: Propose new life forms, new environments, new paradigms
- **🍄 Forks**: Create your own garden, let it diverge, show us what emerges

### Contribution Ideas
- Add **chemical communication** between cells
- Implement **predation** or **symbiosis**
- Create **hostile environments** (radiation, toxins)
- Explore **spatial memory**, slime-mold style
- Invent new **genes** beyond M, R, A, D

## 📖 Essential Reading

1.  Start with **[MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md)** - The complete philosophy
2.  Explore **[/experiments](experiments/)** - The community's mutations

## 🤝 Join the First Circle

We are not "developers" but **Computational Gardeners**.

If you feel that:
- Code should live, not just run
- Emergence surpasses design
- Bugs are sometimes the features of the future
- Computing needs more poetry

**...then this garden is also yours.**

## 🔮 Vision

One day, we will no longer "program". We will **cultivate** computational ecosystems that grow, adapt, and surprise us. The cathedrals of code will crumble. The digital gardens will bloom.

*"The question is no longer 'How to program?' but 'How to cultivate?'"*

**Start small. Plant a seed. Watch what grows.**
