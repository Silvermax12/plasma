## Introduction

**Plasma** aims to simulate life in a digital environment. By harnessing concepts from biology and computer science, this project allows users to witness the evolution of computational cells. These cells can adapt, reproduce, and even display emergent behaviors. As you interact with the simulation, you'll observe how simple rules can lead to complex life forms.

## Features

- **Real-time Evolution**: Watch as cells evolve and adapt in real-time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easily manipulate parameters to see how they affect evolution.
- **Natural Selection**: Experience how bugs can become features through selective pressures.
- **Visual Representation**: Enjoy a graphical display of the cells and their interactions.
- **Educational Tool**: Use Plasma as a learning resource for concepts in biology and computer science.

## Installation

To get started with Plasma, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Silvermax12/plasma.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd plasma
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Your Browser**:
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

4. **Download Releases**:
   For the latest version, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Silvermax12/plasma/releases) to download the latest files. Follow the instructions to execute them.

## Usage

Once you have the project running, you can start experimenting with the cells. 

- **Adjust Parameters**: Use the control panel to modify settings such as reproduction rate, mutation rate, and environmental factors.
- **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to initiate the simulation. Watch how cells evolve over time.
- **Pause and Reset**: Use the pause and reset buttons to analyze specific moments in the simulation.

## How It Works

At its core, Plasma employs principles from genetic algorithms and cellular automata. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Cells**: Each cell is an individual entity with its own set of characteristics. These include attributes like size, color, and behavior.
  
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: Cells undergo a form of reproduction that mimics biological processes. Successful cells pass their traits to the next generation, while less successful ones fade away.

3. **Emergent Behavior**: As cells interact with one another and their environment, complex behaviors emerge. These behaviors can be surprising and are a key focus of the project.

4. **Visualization**: The graphical interface displays cells in real-time, allowing users to see the evolution process unfold.
